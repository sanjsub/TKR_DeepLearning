# TKR_DeepLearning
Worked with clinician mentors at New York University Langone Health to develop a machine learning model to identify patients at risk for total knee replacement based on radiograph images and clinical risk factor data

Folders: 
-	output: contains CSVs generated by various working notebooks (e.g. train CV and test predictions), as well as `selected_clinical_variable_desc.csv` which contains information about features used in the traditional models (baseline logit + final catboost), including their original and renamed column names, sources, descriptions, and derivation formulas if not raw columns.    
-	tkr_methods: contains python files with various data processing, modeling, and analysis methods that imported into Jupyter notebooks  

All work is done in notebooks, located in the root folder. They are either native Colab notebooks, or Jupyter notebooks that are imported into and made compatible with Colab. Results should be reproducible by executing all cells in notebooks in sequence: 
-	DataPrep.ipynb: performs group stratified train/test split, the latter used as a hold-out group for final evaluation; further splits train set into 4-folds for cross validation as needed  
-	Clinical-DataPrep.ipynb: wrangles three separate clinical risk factor datasets (AllClinical00_SAS, Enrollees_SAS, kXR_SQ_BU00_SAS) and combines them into one for modeling 
-	Clinical-Modeling.ipynb: fits and evaluates traditional logistic regression and catboost models on clinical risk factor data
-	X-ray-Modeling.ipynb: fits and evaluates deep learning model on X-ray data
-	Ensemble.ipynb: fits and evaluates models combining the output of traditional models and X-ray models 
-	Analysis.ipynb: generates charts for report (e.g. ROC/Precision-Recall curves), performs statistical analyses
